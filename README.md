Nice to meet you. This is one of my little spaces on the web. Welcome!

My goal with this site is to showcase some of the things I have made or written. Feel free to poke around!

# Writing

Here are some pieces of online writing that I put effort into:

[Why Pricing in Healthcare is Hard](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/ayliu22/issues/why-pricing-is-hard-in-healthcare-1111394)

[No-Code Tools for Healthcare Operations](https://refactoredhealth.substack.com/p/no-code-tools-for-healthcare-operations)

[The Most Important Feature of Software-based Digital Health Products](https://refactoredhealth.substack.com/p/the-most-important-feature-of-software)

[Wellness vs. Disease Management ROI for Employers](https://refactoredhealth.substack.com/p/wellness-vs-disease-management-roi)

# Creative Projects

## Blink Counter (Javascript, HTML, Tensorflow, D3)

Here my goal was to count the number of times I blink each minute as a way of measuring attention.

I like to do little side projects to experiment with new technologies and put my learning into practice. I decided to implement a torus with external shading.

## Three.js and WebGL toy implementation (Javascript)

Here my goal was to play with building 3D models directly in the web browser using three.js.

## Dermatology skin classification (Python, Jupyter, Keras)

Here my goal was to develop a machine learning model that could classify skin images into one of eight different disease categories. The model achieved >50% accuracy, which isn't great, but better than random guessing.

## Diffie-Hellman toy implementation (Vue.js, HTML)

Here my goal was to implement some of the foundational pieces of cryptography from scratch as a means of understanding them better.

## Forward Error Correction toy implementation (Javascript, HTML)

Here my goal was to better understand Forward Error Correction technology by making a toy implementation.

## Fictional telehealth company splash page (Figma)

Here my goal was to get better at web design and Figma.

# Business Stuff

I am open to either engineering or product consulting opportunities. You can find my resume on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuningalexliu/).

# Random

## Printmaking

Sometimes I like to do printmaking for fun.
