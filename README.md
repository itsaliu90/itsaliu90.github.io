# Hi, I'm Alex :)
Nice to meet you! This is one of my little spaces on the web. Feel free to poke around!

# Writing

Here are some essays I've written.

[Why Pricing in Healthcare is Hard](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/ayliu22/issues/why-pricing-is-hard-in-healthcare-1111394)

[No-Code Tools for Healthcare Operations](https://refactoredhealth.substack.com/p/no-code-tools-for-healthcare-operations)

# Software

## Lofi Radio (HTML, Javascript, Tone.js)

[Demo](https://itsaliu90.github.io/lofi/)

## Multi-modal Storybook Generator (OpenAI APIs like DALL-E, Javascript, HTML, CSS)

Here my goal was to play with multi-modal models to generate a coherent story. 

Demo below (password is "turtletown").

## Blink Counter (Javascript, HTML, Tensorflow, D3)

Here my goal was to count the number of times I blink each minute as a way of measuring attention.

I like to do little side projects to experiment with new technologies and put my learning into practice. I decided to implement a torus with external shading.

## Three.js and WebGL toy implementation (Javascript)

Here my goal was to play with building 3D models directly in the web browser using three.js.

## Dermatology skin classification (Python, Jupyter, Keras)

Here my goal was to develop a machine learning model that could classify skin images into one of eight different disease categories. The model achieved >50% accuracy, which isn't great, but better than random guessing.

## Diffie-Hellman toy implementation (Vue.js, HTML)

Here my goal was to implement some of the foundational pieces of cryptography from scratch as a means of understanding them better.

## Forward Error Correction toy implementation (Javascript, HTML)

Here my goal was to better understand Forward Error Correction technology by making a toy implementation.

## Fictional telehealth company splash page (Figma)

Here my goal was to get better at web design and Figma.
