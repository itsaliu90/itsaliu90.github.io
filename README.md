# Hi, I'm Alex :)

Nice to meet you. This is one of my little spaces on the web. Welcome!

My goal with this site is to showcase some of the things I have made or written. Feel free to poke around!

# Projects

I like to do little side projects to experiment with new technologies and put my learning into practice.

## Dermatology skin classification (Python, Jupyter, Keras)

Here my goal was to develop a machine learning model that could classify skin images into one of eight different disease categories. The model achieved >50% accuracy, which isn't great, but better than random guessing.

## Diffie-Hellman toy implementation (Vue.js, HTML)

Here my goal was to implement some of the foundational pieces of cryptography from scratch as a means of understanding them better.

## Forward Error Correction toy implementation (Javascript, HTML)

Here my goal was to better understand Forward Error Correction technology by making a toy implementation.

## Printmaking

Sometimes I like to do printmaking for fun.
